# SwitchMenu
Using a C++ Switch statement to ask the user what they want to do. This is a snippet of a C++ program where I made a Priority Queue through a Heap.

I liked using a Switch for this task because it is clean and easy to follow. Something I would do differently now is not re-pasting the menu each time the user selects an option. 
Perhaps some form of counter might have helped.
